The agent will use environmental defaults for tasks, and tests to minimise the impact on an agent machine.

This will be limiting by default the number of task threads that can be spawned.  A thread = A parallel test being executed, the more threads, the
more parallel tests being executed, and the greater the load on the agent machine.

It is anticipated that there will be multiple agent profiles that people can choose from, to cater for people with more extensive compute and internet, however
the default will be set at a minimum.
